Option 1:
I would like to follow the digital house class /home/linar/Desktop/ML/digital-house-master/M4/CLASE_21_Regresion-Logistica/Notebooks/2_regresiвn_logбstica_guiada_solution.ipynb with the following modifications:
- Review theorical part with the Aman AI (same as cs229 notes).
- Add Logistic Regression implementation from scratch.
    - https://developer.ibm.com/articles/implementing-logistic-regression-from-scratch-in-python/ 
    - https://towardsdatascience.com/building-a-logistic-regression-in-python-301d27367c24
